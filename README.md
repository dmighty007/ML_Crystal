# ML_Crystal: 2D Nucleation Simulation

This project aims to simulate and analyze 2D nucleation scenarios using OpenMM. It focuses on setting up a toy system with Lennard-Jones particles, enforcing strict 2D confinement, and studying nucleation events.

## Objectives

- **Simulation**: Generate 2D nucleation trajectories using OpenMM.
- **Confinement**: Ensure strict 2D geometry using high-stiffness harmonic potentials or velocity projections.
- **Analysis**: Study nucleation pathways and energetics suitable for machine learning integration (implied by 'ML_Crystal').

## Features

- OpenMM-based simulation engine.
- Lennard-Jones particle interactions.
- 2D confinement implementation.
- (Planned) Machine Learning analysis of crystal nucleation.
